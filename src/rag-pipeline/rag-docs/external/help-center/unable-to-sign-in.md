# Unable to sign in to your Coinbase account

If you can’t sign in to your Coinbase account, the steps below can help you troubleshoot common issues such as incorrect passwords, device verification prompts, or 2-step verification problems.

## 1. Check you’re on the official Coinbase site or app

Before entering any login details, make sure:

- The URL is the official Coinbase domain (for example, `https://www.coinbase.com`).
- Your browser shows a secure connection (lock icon).
- You’re using the official Coinbase mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play.

If you reached a login page through a link in an email, verify that the email is legitimate and not a phishing attempt.

## 2. Reset your password

If you see an “incorrect email or password” error:

1. Select **Forgot password?** on the sign-in screen.
2. Enter the email address associated with your Coinbase account.
3. Open the password reset email and follow the instructions.
4. Create a strong, unique password that you do not reuse on other sites.

If you no longer have access to that email address, you’ll need to follow the account recovery process instead.

## 3. Device verification emails or SMS

When you sign in from a new device or location, Coinbase may send a verification email or SMS.

- Check your spam or junk folder for the device verification email.
- If using SMS, confirm your phone number is correct and has mobile coverage.
- Only approve device verification requests that you initiated.

If you did not request a new login, do **not** approve the verification and secure your account immediately.

## 4. Two-step verification (2FA) issues

If you can’t complete 2-step verification:

- Make sure the time on your phone is set automatically and is accurate if you use an authenticator app.
- Confirm you’re using the correct 2FA method (SMS vs authenticator app vs security key).

If you’ve permanently lost access to your 2FA method, you’ll need to start an account recovery process, which may require ID verification and can take several days.

## 5. Account temporarily locked

Your account may be temporarily locked if:

- There are multiple failed sign-in attempts.
- Suspicious activity is detected on your account.

In this case:

- Wait for the specified lockout period to end and try again.
- Check your email for messages from Coinbase about any security concerns.

## 6. When to contact Coinbase Support

Contact Coinbase Support from the official website or app if:

- You suspect someone else is trying to access your account.
- You still can’t sign in after resetting your password and checking 2FA.
- You no longer have access to your registered email address and need help with account recovery.

Support will never ask for your password or your full 2-step verification codes.
