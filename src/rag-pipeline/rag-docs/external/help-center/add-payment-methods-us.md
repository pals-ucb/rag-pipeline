# Add and verify a payment method (US customers)

US customers can use several payment methods to buy crypto and fund their Coinbase accounts. Available methods and limits may vary based on your state, verification level, and account history.

## 1. Supported payment methods in the US

Common options include:

- Bank account (ACH transfer)
- Debit card
- Instant cashout to eligible cards
- Wire transfer (for higher limits)

To see which options are available to you, go to **Settings → Payment methods** in your Coinbase account.

## 2. Add a bank account (ACH)

1. Sign in to Coinbase.
2. Go to **Settings → Payment methods**.
3. Select **Add a payment method**.
4. Choose **Bank account**.
5. Follow the prompts to link your bank securely, either via an instant verification partner or by entering routing and account numbers.

ACH deposits may take several business days to clear. Some deposits may be subject to a holding period before you can withdraw funds.

## 3. Add a debit card

1. Sign in to Coinbase.
2. Go to **Settings → Payment methods**.
3. Select **Add a payment method**.
4. Choose **Debit card**.
5. Enter your card details and billing information.

Debit card purchases are often faster but may have higher fees and lower limits compared with bank transfers.

## 4. Wire transfers

For larger amounts, you may be able to use bank wires:

- Follow the instructions in the **Deposit** section of your account.
- Use the exact reference details provided so your deposit is correctly credited.
- Wires typically arrive within one business day, depending on your bank.

Your bank may charge its own fees for wire transfers.

## 5. Verify and manage your payment methods

After adding a payment method:

- Coinbase may complete small test transactions or authorizations.
- You may need to confirm these amounts or complete additional verification steps.

You can manage your payment methods from **Settings → Payment methods**, including removing old methods or setting a default.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If your payment method cannot be added or is declined:

- Confirm that all information (name, address, card details) matches your bank records.
- Ensure that your bank or card issuer allows transactions with Coinbase.
- See the “Troubleshooting declined or failed buys” article for more detailed steps.
