# Keeping your Coinbase account secure

Coinbase uses multiple security controls to help protect your account, but you play an important role too. This article outlines best practices for keeping your Coinbase account safe.

## 1. Use a strong, unique password

- Choose a long password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Do not reuse passwords from other websites or apps.
- Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store your passwords.

Never share your password with anyone, including someone claiming to be Coinbase Support.

## 2. Enable two-step verification (2FA)

Turn on 2FA to add an extra layer of security:

- Use an authenticator app or hardware security key when possible.
- Avoid relying solely on SMS if stronger options are available.
- Store your backup codes or recovery methods in a safe location.

2FA greatly reduces the risk of someone signing in with just your email and password.

## 3. Protect your email account

Your email account is a key part of your Coinbase security:

- Use strong, unique passwords and 2FA for your email.
- Regularly review sign-in activity and security alerts.
- Beware of phishing emails that try to imitate your email provider or Coinbase.

If an attacker controls your email, they may be able to attempt password resets and device approvals.

## 4. Recognize phishing and scams

Common red flags include:

- Messages that create urgency or threaten account closure.
- Requests to share your password, 2FA codes, or remote access to your computer or phone.
- Links that look like Coinbase but use slightly different spelling or domains.

If you’re unsure, do not click links. Instead, go directly to the official Coinbase app or website and check your account.

## 5. Keep your devices secure

- Install operating system and browser updates regularly.
- Use antivirus or security software where appropriate.
- Lock your phone and computer with a passcode or biometric authentication.

Avoid signing in to your Coinbase account on shared or public devices whenever possible.

## 6. What to do if you suspect a compromise

If you think your account or device may have been compromised:

1. Change your Coinbase and email passwords immediately.
2. Revoke sessions and sign out from devices you don’t recognize.
3. Review transactions and withdrawal history for anything suspicious.
4. Contact Coinbase Support from the official Help Center.

Acting quickly can help limit potential losses and prevent further unauthorized activity.
