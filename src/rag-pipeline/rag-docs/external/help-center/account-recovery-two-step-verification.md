# Recover your account if you lost two-step verification

If you can’t access your two-step verification (2FA) method, you may still be able to recover your Coinbase account by completing an account recovery process.

## 1. When you might need account recovery

You may need account recovery if:

- You lost your phone that had the authenticator app installed.
- You changed phone numbers and no longer receive SMS codes.
- Your hardware security key was lost or no longer works.

If you still have access to at least one 2FA method, use that method instead of starting recovery.

## 2. Start the recovery process

From the Coinbase sign-in screen:

1. Enter your email and password.
2. When prompted for your 2FA code, select the option indicating that you no longer have access to your 2-step verification.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start account recovery.

You may be asked to provide additional information, such as photos of your ID or a selfie, to verify your identity.

## 3. Provide accurate information

To avoid delays:

- Make sure the photos of your documents are clear, well-lit, and not blurry.
- Confirm the personal information you enter matches your account details (name, date of birth, address).
- Respond promptly to any additional questions or instructions sent by Coinbase.

## 4. How long recovery can take

Account recovery may take several days or longer, depending on the complexity of your case and the volume of requests. During this time:

- You may not be able to sign in or withdraw funds.
- Coinbase may impose additional temporary restrictions to protect your account.

This is done to help ensure only the rightful owner regains access.

## 5. After recovery is complete

Once recovery succeeds:

- Sign in and immediately review your **Security** settings.
- Set up a new 2FA method, ideally an authenticator app or security key.
- Review your recent activity and withdrawal history for anything you don’t recognize.

If you see suspicious activity, contact Coinbase Support right away.
