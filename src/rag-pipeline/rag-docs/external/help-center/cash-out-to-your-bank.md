# Cash out your funds to your bank account

You can convert your crypto or cash balance into local currency and withdraw it to your linked bank account. This article explains the general cash out flow for US customers.

## 1. Convert crypto to cash (if needed)

If your funds are currently in crypto:

1. Go to **Buy & sell** or **Trade**.
2. Select the crypto you want to sell.
3. Choose **Sell** and select your local currency (for example, USD).
4. Review the amount and fees, then confirm.

After the sale completes, your cash balance will appear in your Coinbase account.

## 2. Start a cash out

1. Go to your **Assets** or **Portfolio** page.
2. Select your local currency balance (for example, USD).
3. Choose **Cash out** or **Withdraw**.
4. Select your bank account or card as the destination.
5. Enter the amount you want to cash out.
6. Review the fees, estimated arrival time, and any limits.
7. Confirm the cash out.

## 3. Processing times and holds

Processing times depend on the method:

- **ACH bank transfer**: Usually a few business days.
- **Instant cashout to card**: Typically minutes, but may incur higher fees.
- **Wire transfer**: Generally same or next business day once initiated.

Some funds may be subject to holds or withdrawal limits based on risk checks, payment method type, and regulatory requirements.

## 4. Common issues

If your cash out is delayed or fails:

- Confirm your bank account is still active and able to receive transfers.
- Make sure your name on Coinbase matches the name on the bank account.
- Check your email for any messages from Coinbase about additional verification or holds.
- Review your account for any unresolved security alerts.

If the transaction status doesn’t change after the estimated time, contact Coinbase Support using the official Help Center.

## 5. Fees and limits

Cash out fees and limits vary by region, payment method, and account history. Before confirming a withdrawal:

- Review the fees shown on the confirmation screen.
- Check your daily and monthly limits in your **Settings** or cash out screen.

If you need higher limits, you may be prompted to complete additional verification.
