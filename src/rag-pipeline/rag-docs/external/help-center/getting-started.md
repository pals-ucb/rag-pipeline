# Getting started with Coinbase

Coinbase is a platform that helps you buy, sell, and securely store digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This article walks you through the basic steps to create an account and get ready to use Coinbase.

## 1. Check if Coinbase is available in your region

Coinbase products and features vary by country and region. Before you sign up, visit the Coinbase availability page and confirm that your country and identity document type are supported. Some features, like certain payment methods or derivatives trading, may only be available in specific regions.

## 2. Create your account

1. Go to the official Coinbase website or open the Coinbase mobile app.
2. Select **Get started**.
3. Enter your name, email address, and create a strong password.
4. Read and accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy.
5. Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox.

Never share your password or one-time codes with anyone, including someone claiming to be Coinbase Support.

## 3. Verify your identity

Regulations often require Coinbase to verify your identity (KYC). This typically includes:

- Your full legal name
- Date of birth
- Home address
- Government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID)

Depending on your region, you may need to upload photos of your document and sometimes a selfie to confirm it is you.

## 4. Secure your account

Before funding your account:

- Turn on **two-step verification (2FA)** using an authenticator app whenever possible.
- Use a unique, strong password that you don’t reuse on other sites.
- Review your **trusted devices** and sign out of sessions you don’t recognize.

See the “Keeping your Coinbase account secure” article for more details.

## 5. Add a payment method

To buy your first crypto, you’ll need a supported payment method such as:

- Bank account
- Debit card
- Local payment networks (varies by region)

You can add or manage payment methods from **Settings → Payment methods** in the app or website.

## 6. Buy your first crypto

Once your identity is verified and a payment method is added:

1. Select **Buy & sell** or **Trade**.
2. Choose the asset you want to buy.
3. Enter the amount and select your payment method.
4. Review the fees and total cost.
5. Confirm the purchase.

Your assets will appear in your Coinbase portfolio. Some purchases may be subject to a holding period before you can withdraw.

## 7. Where to get help

If you run into issues with sign up, verification, or your first purchase:

- Search the Help Center using keywords like “account verification” or “add payment method”.
- Use the in-app virtual assistant for guided troubleshooting.
- Contact Coinbase Support from the official website or app if you still need help.
