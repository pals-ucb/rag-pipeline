# Contacting Coinbase Support

Most common questions can be solved using the Help Center and in-app assistant, but if you still need help, you can contact Coinbase Support using the official channels listed here.

## 1. Use the Help Center and virtual assistant first

Before reaching out to Support:

- Search the Help Center using keywords related to your issue (for example, “unable to sign in”, “cash out”, “add payment method”).
- Use the in-app virtual assistant to follow a guided troubleshooting flow.

These tools can often resolve issues faster than waiting for a human response.

## 2. Contact Support from the app or website

To contact Support:

1. Sign in to the official Coinbase app or website.
2. Navigate to the **Help** or **Support** section.
3. Follow the prompts to describe your issue.
4. Choose an available contact option, such as messaging or email.

Depending on your region and issue type, phone support or live chat may also be available.

## 3. Information Support may request

To help resolve your issue, Support may ask for:

- Details of any error messages.
- The approximate date, time, and amount of a transaction.
- Screenshots that do **not** show sensitive data such as full card numbers or passwords.

Support will never ask for your password, full 2FA codes, or remote access to your device.

## 4. Beware of fake support

Attackers may pose as Coinbase Support on social media, messaging apps, or unofficial websites. To stay safe:

- Only use contact options from the official Coinbase app or website.
- Do not trust support phone numbers posted by strangers online.
- Never share sensitive information with anyone contacting you unexpectedly.

If you’re unsure whether a message is from Coinbase, ignore it and contact Support directly through official channels.
